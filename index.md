## About Me

Currently, I am a senior at Lehman College located in the Bronx, NY. I am pursuing a bachelors in science in Computer Science
with a minor in Environmental Science. 

## About My Mentor

My mentor is Rebecca A. Hutchinson from Oregon State University. She works on machine learning models and algorithms inspired by ecological problems and datasets. As her website states, she is part of the computational sustainability community, where she finds ways that computer science can contribute to promoting the health of the Earthâ€™s ecosystems and bringing interesting new problems back to computer science. 

## About My Project

The topic that we will be working on this summer is modeling species distributions from remotely sensed data and inferring unseen links in pollination networks. More details about it will be posted as we progress with our project together.
