title: Week 10 August 30th- September 3rd
---
This week was a bit more difficult to communicate with my teammate since by now our fall semester has started.
We created an outline for our final paper, and decided who was going to do each section. As I was writting down my parts, I realized how it would not be possible to finish the paper in a week, so I talked to my mentor about it. As soon as we complete our first draft, we will share it with our mentor to receive feeback and make the necessary changes.
