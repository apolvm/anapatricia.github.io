title: Week 2 July 6th- July 9th
---

This week my teammate and I worked on generating data to create occupancy models so we could start getting a bit more understanding on how to deal with data and how to work with the functions included in the Unmarked package. Our goal was to answer the following question: re the parameters better with 100 sites and 2 visits, or 150 and 3 visits? 
At first, we were having difficulty trying to make our code to work since every time we would try to run it we would encounter an error, "R Session Aborted- R encounter a fatal error. The session was terminated.‚Äù We were able to surpass this error, however we are still not sure what was the cause of it.
