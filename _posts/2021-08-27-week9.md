title: Week 9 August 23th- August 27th

As we approach the end of our program, we are wrapping up our project and creating the last visualizations.
Using the predict values from the WETA and covariates dataframe, we visualized these values by plotting them according to latitude and longitude. We ended up with a map of Oregon state. Our predictions showed how it is more likely to detect species in the SouthWest part of Oregon which is surrounded by national forests (Suislaw, Williamette, Umpqua). Our data size was of 9,170 observations. Using the same steps we took in week 8, we utilize data from our mentor Eugene from all parts of Oregon State and visualize the predictions of said data. Even with this new data, SouthWest is the best place to detect species.
